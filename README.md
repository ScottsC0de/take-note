## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
This project is a note taking app called "Take Note", which utilizes *Express.js* for its back-end functioning, HTML and CSS for the front-end, and Heroku for deployment. Heroku is a Platform as a Service that supports node.js and allows you to build, run, operate, and deploy apps straight from the cloud. Express.js is a lightweight framework for node.js that lets you make API calls and HTTPS requests as well as create routes. *Routes* refer to the pathways data is sent between computers. With this app, we've set up a server in a server.js file and two routing files that connect the front-end of this app with the back-end. Using the get(), post(), and delete() Express methods (methods are ways of communicating with another computer), we are able to request JSON data from a database containing the users saved notes. Whenever the user returns to the page, their notes will be posted from their previous visit.
